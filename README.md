# Module 12 Challenge - Employee Tracker

## Description
In this project, I was tasked with creating an employee tracker application, which allows users to view and add employees with different departments and roles into a tracker system. This was achieved by using MYSQL2, Inquirer, and console.table package. 

The application functionality can be viewed in this video walkthrough: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1nU4J9iAMz0r_Uy4eFyEmhiNH9rCev5lP/view
